# 🐍 Day 5 – Comments, Escape Sequences & Statements

Welcome to Day 5 of my Python learning journey!  
This script explores how Python handles comments, escape sequences, and print statement formatting — with a personal poetic twist.

## 📘 What’s Inside

This file demonstrates:

- **Single-line comments** using `#`
- **Multi-line strings** used as comments with triple quotes `"""..."""`
- **Escape sequences** like:
  - `\n` for newline  
  - `\t` for tab  
  - `\"` for double quotes inside strings
- **Print statement formatting** using:
  - `sep="..."` to separate values  
  - `end="..."` to customize line endings

## ✨ Sample Output

```plaintext
To the Miss Perfectionist : 
    To others, they call her ‘she,’
    But the word ‘she’ is the universe itself.
    Yes, there are countless universes in space,
    But to me, she is the only universe.
    Until I realized, she is the verse,
    Woven into my tangled "heart."
