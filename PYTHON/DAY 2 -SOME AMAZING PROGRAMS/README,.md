# üöÄ Python Day 2 ‚Äì Some Amazing Programs

This folder contains beginner-friendly Python projects inspired by Day 2 of CodeWithHarry‚Äôs Python playlist. Each program demonstrates core Python concepts in a fun and practical way.

> üìå **Note from Sushant:**  
> I‚Äôve just started learning Python and this folder is part of my Day 2 progress. The code here is taken from CodeWithHarry‚Äôs GitHub and video series. I‚Äôm still exploring and understanding each program, and I‚Äôve added this to match Day 2 of my own Python learning series on YouTube.
