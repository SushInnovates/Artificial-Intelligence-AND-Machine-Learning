~ Modules and Pip
1>  Modules is like a code library which can be used to borrow the code written by somebody else in our python program.
There are two types of modules
    • Built im Modules -
                        These modules ame ready to import and use and ships with the python interpreter. there is no need to install such modules explicitly.

    • External Modules -
                        These modules are imported from a third party file or can be installed using a package manager lilie pip or conda. Since this code is written by someone else, we can install different versions of a same module with time
2> we can install modules and packages using 
    pip install package/module_name
        ex 1- pip install pandas    
        ex 2- pip install scikit-learn
        ex 3 - pip install Tensorflow

3> Using a modules in python(usage)
we use the import sytax to import a module in python . here is the example
```
import pandas
# read and work with the file names 'words.csv'
pandas.read_csv('words.csv')

````

similarly we can install other modules and look into their documentation for usage instructions. we will find ourselved doing this in the 
later part of this course
