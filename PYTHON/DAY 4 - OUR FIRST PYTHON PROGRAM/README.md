# 🐍 Day 4 – Our First Python Program

Welcome to Day 4 of my Python learning journey! Today I wrote and ran my very first Python program. It’s simple, but it marks the beginning of hands-on coding practice.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to use the print() function to display text and numbers.
- Python handles both strings and arithmetic operations inside print().
- Basic syntax: no semicolons, indentation matters, and parentheses are required for functions.
